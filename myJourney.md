## My journey throught learning node

# 23 January

Okay so today i started of basic, learned about global variables and how there is not window object in node since we are working with a server. 

Thereafter i learned how to create our own modules and export them locally to use in different files, and how we can use the require() function to basically import what was exported from different files.

And then i learned some of the build in node modules like os, fs, http and path and how we can use each of them, and learned some of their functions, the fs-async functons to read and write to files were pretty interesting and how we have to use nested callbacks to manage task asyncronously. 

Then i learned about the node packate managerand how we can technically use it to install or rather use code written by other devs to ease our lives.
